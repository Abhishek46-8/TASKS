1. Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 
   HTTP/1.1 takes care of this problem by introducing persistent connections 
   and pipelining. With persistent connections, HTTP/1.1 assumes that a TCP 
   connection should be kept open unless directly told to close. This allows
   the client to send multiple requests along the same connection without waiting
   for a response to each, greatly improving the performance of HTTP/1.1 over HTTP/1.0.

   HTTP/2 multiplexes streams of data within a single TCP connection. As a result, 
   receive windows on the level of the TCP connection are not sufficient to regulate
   the delivery of individual streams. HTTP/2 solves this problem by allowing the client 
   and server to implement their own flow controls, rather than relying on the transport 
   layer. The application layer communicates the available buffer space, allowing the 
   client and server to set the receive window on the level of the multiplexed streams.
   This fine-scale flow control can be modified or maintained after the initial connection 
   via a WINDOW_UPDATE frame.

3. List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) vs Nodejs 
   i)Javascript is capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM.         |	Nodejs does not have capability to add HTML tags.
  ii)Javascript can run in any browser engine.			             |	Nodejs can only run in V8 engine of google chrome.
 iii)Javascript is used in frontend development.			     |	Nodejs is used in server-side development.
  iv)Javascript can only be run in the browsers.			     |	NodeJS code can be run outside the browser.
   v)It is the upgraded version of ECMA script that uses Chrome’s V8         |	Nodejs is written in C, C++ and Javascript.
     engine written in C++.

4. what happens when you type a URL in the address bar in the browser?
 i)The browser checks the cache for a DNS record to find the corresponding IP address of the url entered.
ii)If the requested URL is not in the cache, ISP’s DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of the server.
iii)The browser initiates a TCP connection with the server.
iv) The browser sends an HTTP request to the webserver.
 v)The server handles the request and sends back a response.
vi)The server sends out an HTTP response.
vii)The browser displays the HTML content
